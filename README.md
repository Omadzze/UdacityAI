# Generative AI Nanodegree - Udacity Exercises Solutions

This repository contains solutions to the exercises I completed during the [Generative AI Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/generative-ai--nd608) program from Udacity.

## Overview

The Generative AI Nanodegree is designed to provide hands-on experience in developing AI systems. Throughout the course, I worked on several exercises that cover key concepts in machine learning, adopting open-source models, applying fine-tuning to foundational models, and more. I have published this repository to share my **completed solutions** for a few exercises that I did. These answers reflect the work I did during my learning journey. The repository is structured to match the course modules and exercises, with each folder containing relevant code, comments, and insights gained from each topic.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Omadzze/UdacityAI.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the exercise folder of your choice.

3. Each folder contains instructions on how to run the scripts or notebooks, along with required dependencies.

## Disclaimer

Please note that these solutions are based on my own understanding and efforts while completing the Nanodegree. I encourage others to attempt the exercises independently before referring to these solutions, as working through the problems is key to the learning experience.
